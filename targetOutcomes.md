For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section for Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Consistent with many findings reported in the existingliterature (e.g., Lyubomirsky et al., 2011; Seligman et al.,2005), our results showed that writing a gratitude letterwas a positive experience. Expressers reported being ina significantly more positive mood than normal (M =2.58, SD = 1.30), one-sample t(106) = 20.59, p < .0001,d = 1.98, and reported being in a more positive moodafter sending the gratitude letter than they did at thebaseline measurement (M = 0.46, SD = 1.66), t(98) =10.89, p < .0001, d = 1.09.More important for our current hypotheses, expressersalso systematically undervalued the positive impacttheir gratitude letter would have on recipients. As shown in Figure 1, expressers significantly underestimatedhow surprised recipients would be to receivethe letter, paired-samples t(79) = 6.09, p < .0001, d =0.68; underestimated how surprised they would be bythe content of the letter, paired-samples t(79) = 3.49,p < .001, d = 0.40; underestimated how positive recipientswould feel, paired-samples t(79) = 6.60, p < .0001,d = 0.74; and overestimated how awkward recipientswould feel, paired-samples t(79) = −2.89, p < .01, d =0.32. Expressers believed that receiving gratitude wouldbe a relatively positive experience, but it was even morepositive for recipients than they expected.It is important to note that these results do not necessarilyindicate imperfect insight into a recipient’sunique response to a gratitude letter. Expressers couldtheoretically have complete insight into their own recipient’sunique experience compared with other recipients,even if expressers are systematically miscalibratedon each item. That is, expressers could show a highdegree of discrimination accuracy, indexed as a correlationbetween predicted and actual experiences, evenwhile being miscalibrated, as indexed by a differencebetween the average predicted and actual experience.Figure 1, however, shows that this was not the case.The correlations between expressers’ predicted ratingsand their recipient’s actual ratings were consistentlysmall, being significantly larger than zero only whenexpressers predicted surprise at receiving the letter(r = .35, p < .01). Accuracy correlations for predictedsurprise at the content of the letter, mood, and awkwardnesswere all nonsignificantly different from zero (all ps > .2). Expressers did not appear to have greatinsight into their recipient’s unique experience, andthey systematically underestimated how positive receivinggratitude would be for recipients.
